File HeavyWater_Soper.h5 is the measured data from Soper(2013).
Folder HW_nonbiased_Data is generated by Prompt using total_scattering.gdml with non-biased heavy water sample and incident neutron number 2e10.
Folder HW_biased_Data is generated by Prompt using total_scattering.gdml with biased heavy water sample and incident neutron number 2e9.
The plot.py script shows the comparison between normalization of simulation data and measured data, and also compares P(Q) for different scattering numbers obtained from non-biased and biased runs. 
The two results of plot.py are respectively the figure 8 and figure 9 in the paper.
